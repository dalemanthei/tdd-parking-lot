## Intro

Red -> Green -> Refactor - I will always ask "Is there anything you want to change?" 
This does not mean that I see something that can be simplified, but i will always ask.

Ask "What will happen when we run this?"


## Grading

### Communication

- Did they go silent for more than a few moments

### Attitude

- Did they react well to failing tests
- Did they react well having to refactor change state, etc

### Technical Ability (how far did you get)

- Did the simplest thing possible first
- remove complexity as part of refactoring
- not concerned about past or future tests, not thinking too far ahead

Three Rules Rules of TDD:
1. No production code unless it is to make a failing test pass.
1. Write the smallest / simplest amount of code to get the test to pass.
1. Write the smallest / simplest test possible.
